# What does is do
This program is used to automatically move the Civilization V singleplayer mods to the right folder to use them in the multiplayer.

# Requirements
- Not every mod will work in the multiplayer this is a little bit of trial and error.
- Everyone playing must have the same mods. (So everyone has to run this program)
- At the moment, this only works if the Brave New World DLC is installed.

# Installation
- Download the mods from the Steam Workshop you want to use in the multiplayer. Keep in mind that not every mod will work in multiplayer, especially .lua coded mods.
- Download the main.exe here [https://github.com/niggiover9000/MuellMeiers5/blob/main/dist/main.exe] and run it.

# If something goes wrong
Browse XXX:\Steam\SteamApps\common\Sid Meier's Civilization V\Assets\DLC\Expansion2
The program backs up the "Expansion2.Civ5Pkg" file as "Expansion2.Civ5Pkg.old". Delete the "Expansion2.Civ5Pkg" and replace it with the "Expansion2.Civ5Pkg.old" if there is a problem.
